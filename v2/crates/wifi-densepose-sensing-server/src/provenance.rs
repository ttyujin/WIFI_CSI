//! ADR-295 — canonical source-provenance state machine.
//!
//! Source state used to be a boolean (`live` vs. not), so any ambiguous
//! condition — an unauthenticated status-endpoint error, a simulator that has
//! not yet produced a frame — collapsed to "live". Two release-path defects
//! (issues #1526, #1557) both trace to that collapse.
//!
//! This module defines one canonical, mutually-exclusive [`SourceState`] and a
//! **pure** transition function of `(last_frame_age, auth_status, source_kind)`.
//! It touches no clock and no socket, so every rule below is unit-testable:
//!
//! - `Unknown` is not a state. An ambiguous condition resolves to
//!   `LiveUnverified`, `Stale`, or `Disconnected` — never `LiveVerified`.
//! - A status-endpoint error resolves to `Disconnected`/`LiveUnverified`,
//!   never live-verified (issue #1526).
//! - A `Synthetic` source can never transition to any `Live*` state without
//!   being reconstructed as a live source *and* presenting a verified frame
//!   (issue #1557).
//! - `Synthetic` is watermarked in every export ([`SourceState::export_watermark`]).
