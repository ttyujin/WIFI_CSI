//! The sensing modality tag (ADR-320 §1).
//!
//! [`Modality`] enumerates the phenomenon class a sensor measures. It is the
//! only place the pipeline distinguishes "how the world was sensed"; every
//! modality flows through the same [`SensorHal`](crate::SensorHal) trait into
//! the same canonical [`Observation`](ruview_ontology::Observation), so the
//! world model never branches on a modality-specific frame shape (ADR-300 rule
//! 3: one canonical semantics downstream).
