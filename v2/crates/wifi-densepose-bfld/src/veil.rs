//! WiFi Veil advisory integration (ADR-294).
//!
//! Bridges BFLD's privacy layer to the [`wifi-veil`](https://github.com/ruvnet/wifi-veil)
//! countermeasure crate: a deterministic, dependency-free attacker-vs-protector
//! model of BFI identity leakage and keyed emission-shaping ("shield")
//! configurations.
//!
//! # Evidence discipline
//!
//! Everything this module produces is **`SYNTHETIC` / evidence level L0** by
//! construction: `wifi-veil` models compliant waveform controls on synthetic
//! scenes and never touches a radio. Assessments quantify the *modeled*
//! re-identification risk of unprotected beamforming feedback and the *modeled*
//! effect of a shield; they are advisory inputs to privacy posture, never
//! measured hardware claims. See ADR-294 and the wifi-veil README.
//!
//! # Relationship to BFLD invariants
//!
//! BFLD's structural invariants (I1–I3, see the crate README) govern data that
//! *enters* this node. WiFi Veil addresses the complementary surface: what this
//! node's own *outgoing* feedback leaks to passive third parties. The
//! integration is advisory-only — nothing here emits RF, alters frames, or
//! relaxes a BFLD gate.
