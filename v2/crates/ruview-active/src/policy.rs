//! The closed-loop experiment controller (ADR-309 §2).
//!
//! **SYNTHETIC / L0 model scaffold.** This is the *loop* ADR-280 deferred: it
//! reads a modelled per-zone uncertainty and the last modelled response, and
//! proposes the next controllable measurement configuration expected to reduce
//! that uncertainty most. It is an information-driven **planning** policy — it
//! shares the *notion* of expected gain with ADR-314 but defines its own
//! control vocabulary and takes **no** dependency on `ruview-infogain`, so the
//! two crates build in parallel.
//!
//! No number here is `MEASURED`. Every exploration level is a modelled
//! magnitude, not a measured information gain (CLAUDE.md honesty discipline).
//! The controller **emits a plan; it never emits RF** and never bypasses the
//! ADR-280 governed admission/actuation surface — a fielded caller submits each
//! proposal through that fail-closed path.
//!
//! ## First-class UNKNOWN (ADR-300 rule 1)
//!
//! The last response is [`LastResponse::Unknown`] whenever the previous
//! solicited measurement returned nothing interpretable. UNKNOWN is **not**
//! zero uncertainty and **not** an error: the policy *widens* exploration by
//! [`ControllerConfig::unknown_widen`] rather than committing to a narrow,
//! exploitative configuration on a target it cannot currently resolve.
