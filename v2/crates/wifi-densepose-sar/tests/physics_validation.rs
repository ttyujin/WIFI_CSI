//! Checks the reconstruction's *actual* behavior against the closed-form
//! predictions in `wifi_densepose_sar::resolution`, rather than merely
//! asserting the formulas in documentation (ADR-287 §3, the
//! ruview-unified "proven, not asserted" discipline).
//!
//! Three physical claims are validated end-to-end (forward-simulate ->
//! backproject -> measure the reconstruction's behavior):
//!
//! 1. Two point targets separated along *range* resolve into two distinct
//!    peaks only once their separation exceeds `range_resolution_m`.
//! 2. Two point targets separated along *cross-range* (same range,
//!    different bearing) resolve only once the synthetic-aperture length
//!    is long enough per `cross_range_resolution_m` -- a single short
//!    aperture cannot resolve them no matter how much bandwidth is used.
//! 3. Antenna-position error decoheres the reconstruction: coherent focus
//!    at the true target location trends downward as position error
//!    grows past the `max_coherent_pose_error_m` (`λ/8`) budget, and has
//!    collapsed toward the incoherent background by an order of
//!    magnitude beyond it.
