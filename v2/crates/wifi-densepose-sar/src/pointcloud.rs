//! Extract a sparse point cloud from a dense [`ReflectivityImage`].
//!
//! A `nx * ny * nz` voxel grid is not a useful end product on its own --
//! real point-cloud consumers (visualization, `ruview-unified`'s
//! `GaussianMap`, downstream fusion) want a short list of "here is
//! something" points, not every voxel. This module does simple
//! threshold + local-maximum extraction: no clustering, no material
//! classification, no confidence calibration against real data (ADR-287
//! §5 -- explicitly out of scope for this crate).
