//! Canonical entity types: the `Site ▸ Building ▸ Floor ▸ Space ▸ Zone`
//! containment spine and the leaf entities located within it (ADR-306 §1).
//!
//! Containment is expressed by a typed `parent` field on each spine node and a
//! [`Container`] reference on each leaf. This is the pure-hierarchy analogue of
//! the `worldgraph` `PartOf`/`LocatedIn` edges: a `Zone` is part of exactly one
//! `Space`, a `Space` on exactly one `Floor`, and so on. The [`WorldGraph`]
//! registry enforces those single-parent invariants.
