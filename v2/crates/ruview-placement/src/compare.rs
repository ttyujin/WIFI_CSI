//! Post-install loop: predicted vs. measured observability → adjustments
//! (ADR-308 §3).
//!
//! **This crate never measures.** The `measured` observability values are
//! supplied by the caller — the ADR-302 runtime observability signal from freshly
//! enrolled, calibrated sensors — and this module only *compares* them against the
//! optimizer's own SYNTHETIC/L0 prediction. The predicted side stays labelled
//! `L0`; a `MEASURED` statement, if any, belongs to the caller's measured input
//! together with its reproducer (CLAUDE.md hardware rule). Where measurement
//! disagrees with prediction, the module recommends an adjustment and a coarse
//! twin-parameter residual to feed back into the ADR-315 twin. Following ADR-300
//! rule 1, a target with no measured value yields a first-class UNKNOWN verdict,
//! never an error.
