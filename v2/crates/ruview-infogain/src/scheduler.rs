//! The information-gain scheduler: rank candidates by value of information and
//! select the most informative subset under a resource budget (ADR-314 §2).
//!
//! **SYNTHETIC / L0 scaffold (ADR-282).** The scheduler emits an *allocation*
//! (a [`SchedulePlan`]), never a measurement and never a sensing claim. It has
//! **no** side effects: it starts no sampling, touches no hardware, and asserts
//! no efficiency figure — ADR-309 active sensing chooses the probe on each
//! selected sensor and ADR-311 fusion incorporates the result. A scheduling
//! decision is a resource choice, not evidence.
//!
//! ## Selection algorithm (documented)
//!
//! The value function is
//!
//! ```text
//! Value(action) = expected_uncertainty_reduction / weighted_cost
//! ```
//!
//! where `weighted_cost` collapses the compute/energy/bandwidth triple under the
//! configured [`CostPolicy`](crate::CostPolicy). Maximising total expected
//! reduction under a multi-resource budget is a knapsack; this scheduler uses a
//! **bounded greedy** heuristic — sort candidates by value density (reduction
//! per unit weighted cost) and take each that still fits the remaining budget.
//! It is `O(n log n)`, allocates one bounded working vector, and is fully
//! deterministic. A candidate that does not fit is deferred, not dropped, and
//! the scheduler keeps scanning lower-density candidates that may still fit —
//! so a small cheap action can be picked after a large one is skipped.
//!
//! Two policies sit on top of the greedy core:
//! - **Sampling floor**: a candidate whose `cycles_since_sampled` has reached
//!   the configured floor is *force-included* (subject only to the hard budget)
//!   so a low-value sensor is re-evaluated as the scene changes rather than
//!   being starved permanently.
//! - **Unknown-value handling**: a candidate with an
//!   [`Unknown`](crate::ExpectedReduction::Unknown) reduction is never treated
//!   as zero — the [`UnknownPolicy`] either probes it (assigns an explicit probe
//!   value so budget is spent to *learn* its informativeness) or defers it.
