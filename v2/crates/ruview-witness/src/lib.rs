//! `ruview-witness` — the staged, append-only, hash-linked witness chain.
//!
//! This crate implements **ADR-319** (witness chain), primitive 19 of the
//! ADR-300 perception substrate. Instead of emitting a bare boolean
//! ("person present"), RuView emits a *chain* whose ordered stages record the
//! auditable reasoning behind an output:
//!
//! ```text
//! RF observation ▸ DSP evidence ▸ model inference ▸ independent corroboration
//!               ▸ spatial state ▸ policy decision
//! ```
//!
//! Each stage is a typed record carrying its own [`Confidence`] and its
//! provenance ([`EvidenceLevel`]). The chain is **hash-linked**: each stage
//! binds the hash of the prior stage ([`Stage::prior_hash`]), and the chain
//! carries the recomputed [`WitnessChain::head`] of its terminal stage, so an
//! in-place mutation, a reordering, or a broken link is detectable by
//! [`WitnessChain::verify`] without trusting the emitting host.
//!
//! ## Relationship to sibling ADRs
//!
//! - **ADR-305 ([`ruview_attest`])** roots the chain: the first stage is built
//!   from an authenticated [`VerifiedMeasurement`]
//!   ([`WitnessChain::from_measurement`]), so the whole chain descends from a
//!   verified chain of custody. The stage hash reuses `ruview-attest`'s BLAKE3
//!   ([`ruview_attest::PayloadHash`]) — no separate hash primitive is added.
//! - **ADR-295** contributes [`SourceState`]: a `Synthetic` root can never
//!   present as `LiveVerified`, and it caps the chain's effective evidence
//!   level.
//! - **ADR-302** contributes [`DomainState`] (the `KNOWN → DEGRADED → UNKNOWN`
//!   staleness guard): a low-confidence or out-of-distribution inference is
//!   recorded as such, never silently promoted.
//! - **ADR-321** will attach the real terminal [`PolicyDecision`]; here it is a
//!   faithfully-typed placeholder for the governed action taken (or withheld).
//!
//! ## Honesty discipline (ADR-300 rule 1 / CLAUDE.md)
//!
//! [`Confidence::Unknown`] is a first-class value, never an error. A missing
//! corroboration is recorded as [`Corroboration::None`], never fabricated. The
//! chain's *effective* evidence level is the **minimum** across its stages, so
//! the chain can never claim more than its weakest link.
//!
//! ### Evidence grade
//!
//! Like `ruview-attest`, any guarantee exercised by this crate's tests is
//! **SYNTHETIC / L0** — the fixtures are constructed in code, never captured
//! from silicon. Hash-linking here is tamper-*evident* against in-place
//! mutation; deployment-grade non-repudiation additionally requires the ADR-305
//! per-stage RuField signatures, layered on top of this structure, plus
//! real-hardware evidence.
