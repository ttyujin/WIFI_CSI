//! Counterfactual scoring and best-explanation selection (ADR-313 §2, §3).
//!
//! **SYNTHETIC / L0 — a research-forward generative-scoring scaffold, not a
//! measurement system.** This module scores a small set of scene
//! [`Hypothesis`](crate::Hypothesis) against an observed link-measurement set,
//! using the ADR-315 [`RfTwin`] as the generative forward model. It is a
//! *consumer* of the twin, not a second simulator: the twin supplies the
//! baseline expected distribution per link (geometry + propagation), and this
//! layer applies a **documented SYNTHETIC occupant-attenuation model** on top —
//! a hypothesized occupant attenuates any link whose line of sight passes near
//! it. Nothing here is a hardware, `MEASURED`, or accuracy claim; this crate
//! asserts **no** discrimination-accuracy number (ADR-313 evidence discipline).
//!
//! ## Likelihood (documented SYNTHETIC)
//!
//! For each observed link with a known base distribution `N(m0, v0)` from the
//! twin, the occupant-adjusted distribution under a hypothesis is
//! `N(m0 - att, v0 + extra)`, where `att`/`extra` accumulate a linear-falloff
//! body effect over occupants that block the link. The per-link explanatory
//! score is the Gaussian log-likelihood of the observed value under that
//! adjusted distribution; a hypothesis's score is the sum over evaluated links.
//! This is a deliberately simple, deterministic model — clearly a scaffold, not
//! real RF.
//!
//! ## UNKNOWN is first-class (ADR-300 rule 1, ADR-313 §3)
//!
//! The layer never forces a label. It returns [`BestExplanation::Unknown`] when
//! the top two hypotheses are near-indistinguishable (margin below threshold),
//! when **no** hypothesis explains the observation well (best mean per-link
//! log-likelihood below a floor — the observation is outside what the twin can
//! account for, routed to the ADR-302 UNKNOWN verdict rather than a forced
//! occupancy label), when no hypotheses are supplied, or when no observed link
//! is evaluable against the twin.
