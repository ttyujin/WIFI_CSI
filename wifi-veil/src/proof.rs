//! Deterministic proof bundle — the byte-stable witness for VEIL.
//!
//! Mirrors the `nvsim` / `archive/v1` proof pattern: run a fixed reference
//! experiment, fold its salient outputs into a single FNV-1a witness, and pin
//! that witness as a constant. If any constant drifts — the PRNG stream, the
//! rotation schedule, the throughput formula, the scene geometry — the witness
//! changes and the test fails loudly.
//!
//! The witness is derived from **quantized** outputs (accuracies to 1e-4,
//! throughput to 1e-6) so that legitimate cross-platform f32 round-off in the
//! last bits does not spuriously break the proof, while any real change to the
//! experiment's behavior still does.
